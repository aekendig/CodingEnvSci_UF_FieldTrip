Guidelines to keep track of who's working on what:
1. Identify issues to work on in the Issues tab or outlined in the science_curriculum or coding_curriculum documents
2. Add issue to Issues tab if not there already
3. Assign yourself
4. Label as active and add labels as needed (e.g. question)
5. Close issue after pull request has been merged
