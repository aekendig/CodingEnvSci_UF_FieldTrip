## Ignore the code below

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## How this works

Now you'll be working straight in RStudio. The code is highlighted in gray and all the other text has a white background. You can run the code in the gray box with the little green arrow. You can also edit it right in the box.

## Load packages

Load the plotting package, ggplot2, by running the code below.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

If the window below this one collapsed, use the icon on the bottom right that shows two squares to restore it.

## Import data

We entered the data you collected at the research station and put it into the "data" folder. Now, import the data from that folder by running the code below. 

```{r}
bio <- read.csv("./data/biodiversity_example_data.csv")
```
