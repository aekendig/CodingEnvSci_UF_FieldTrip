```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Tasks for completing coding curriculum:

-   Editing the outline with additional ideas and modifications

-   Writing R markdown scripts for sections

-   Testing lessons on your computer or in the computer lab

## Learning Goals

1.  Understand how data collected from experiments leads to conclusions

2.  Gain confidence in ability to code

3.  Learn about uncertainty/variation/the limits of scientific inference

**Work backwards from data they will work with to skills for visualization**

## Overview

1.  Time: 1:15 pm -- 4:pm

2.  Location: Architecture 116

3.  Lessons

    a.  Introduction to R
    
    b.  Analyzing data: Biodiversity and its benefits

    c.  Analyzing data: Invasive species and infections

    d.  If time: Using publicly available data to answer your own
        questions

4.  Refer to the full-science-curriculum document for experiment details
    relevant to b and c

5.  Lessons will involve walking through concepts while students follow
    along on their computers and then an opportunity for them to try
    concepts on their own.

## Introduction to R

1.  Overview of what R is

2.  R Studio set up

3.  Basic concepts that will be needed for the next sections

    a.  Variable naming - NOSPACES
    
        i. Commonly used: variablename, variable_name, variable.name, variableName, VariableName
        
        ii. Recommend: variable_name 
    
    b.  Commenting code: e.g., #this is a comment, so won't be read by R
    
    c.  Calculations
    
        i. Add/subtract, multiply/divide. Use vectors?
        
        ii. Intro to functions: mean, median, sqrt

    d.  Dataframe
    
        i. Data types? numeric, character, factor

    e.  Plots

    f.  Packages?

        i.  ggplot
        
        ii. dplyr? magrittr? depending on data manipulations

## Analyzing data: Biodiversity and its benefits

1.  Import data

    a. read.csv, readr::read_csv, readxl::read_excel

2.  Plot biomass vs. species richness

    a.  Point plots

3.  On their own: plots of pollinators or infection severity vs. species
    richness

4.  Not sure how far into the stats to go. Options:

    b.  Mini lesson on linear regression

    c.  ggplot linear regressions: 'lm' vs. 'lowess' method

    d.  lm function

5.  Translate into a verbal conclusion, talk about variation and next
    steps

## Analyzing data: Invasive species and infectious disease

1.  Import data

2.  Make new variables:

    a.  LMA = weight / leaf area

    b.  Infection severity = area infected / leaf area
    
    c.  Add to a data frame: data_frame$LMA = weight / leaf_area

3.  3-D plot of plant traits with points colored by species and shapes
    by origin

4.  On their own: change the color palette or shapes

5.  Plots of infection severity vs. leaf traits and origin

    c.  Point plots

    d.  Bar graphs or boxplots

6.  Build upon stats concepts from last lesson because there are
    multiple predictor variables

7.  On their own: write their conclusions in words following the model
    from the last lesson

### Using publicly available data to answer your own questions

1.  Given some dataset options that could include similar analyses to
    those above

2.  In groups of 2-3, write their own question and use the methods they
    learned to answer it

    -   This doesn't seem super helpful, but I like that it asks
        questions and gives feedback

-   <https://swirlstats.com/students.html>

    -   Interactive (is within R), but not as visually appealing as the
        Hour of Code programs

    -   Easy and interactive, but requires personal information to log
        on
