# Science Curriculum Development

Below is the outline of ideas for the science curriculum. If you're
interested in helping out with this aspect, some tasks include:

-   Editing the outline with additional ideas and modifications

-   Writing scripts for sections

-   Making sure the right supplies get to the right place

## Learning Goals

1.  See some examples of university-level research

2.  Understand some fundamental concepts in ecology

3.  Learn about the impacts of humans on the environment

## Overview

1.  Time: 10 am -- 12 pm

2.  Location: A greenhouse and Bivens Arm Research Station

3.  Lessons

    a.  Invasive species and infectious disease

    b.  Introduction to Bivens Arm

    c.  Biodiversity and its benefits

## Invasive species and infectious disease

1.  **Mini lecture concepts**

    a.  Invasive species

        i.  EDDMapS app

    b.  Infectious disease

    c.  Plant traits

    d.  Question: Does the origin (i.e. native vs. invasive) of plant
        species or their traits affect susceptibility to disease?

    e.  Hypotheses:

        ii. Pathogens are less adapted to infect invasive species,
            leading to fewer disease symptoms.

        iii. Fast-growing, broad-leaf plants have more resources
            available to pathogens, leading to more disease symptoms.

2.  **Experimental design:** Plant *Microstegium vimineum* and native
    grasses in pots in the greenhouse, move them out to Bivens, move
    them back to the greenhouse after a few days, incubate in plastic
    bags to promote foliar fungal infection. If infection doesn't work,
    we can just talk about plant traits.

3.  **Data collection:** In the groups of 2-3, students will collect data on
    plant traits and disease symptoms for multiple species in the
    greenhouse

    f.  Measure height

    g.  Scan leaf for leaf area and damage (won't necessarily know cause)

    h.  Measure leaf weight

4.  **Supplies (5 each)**

    i.  Data sheets

    j.  Pencils

    k.  Clipboards

    l.  Rulers/tape measures

    m.  Scanner and computer

    n.  Scales

    o.  Weigh boats

## Introduction to Bivens Arm

1.  Describe current research taking place here

    a.  Drought/invasion experiment

        i.  Soil microbial communities

        ii. Animals and granivory
        
        iii. Invasion, fire, plant community

    b.  Microstegium trial

    c.  Others? Greenhouse?

## Biodiversity and its benefits

1.  **Mini lecture concepts**

    a.  Biodiversity

        i.  Species richness

        ii. What is a species?

    b.  Ecosystem functions

        iii. Biomass

        iv. Disease suppression

        v.  Pollination

    c.  Question: Does higher species richness lead to more biomass,
        greater disease suppression, and/or higher pollinator abundance?

    d.  Hypotheses:

        vi. Higher species richness leads to more biomass unless a
            high-biomass invasive species is present in the community.

        vii. Higher species richness leads to fewer disease symptoms
            because specialist pathogens are prevented from spreading
            rapidly.

        viii. Higher species richness leads to more pollinators because
            more specialized pollinators are more likely to have
            food/reproductive host plants present in the community.

2.  Experimental design:
    [**BARS experimental plots**](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2729)

3.  Data collection: In groups of 2-3, students will collect data from
    the drought/invasion experiments on species richness, an
    approximation for biomass, and either pollinator or disease
    intensity.

    e.  Hold PVC quadrats over a plot

    f.  Record number of observable plant species (morphological
        differences)

        ix. Can use [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) for species identification

    g.  Use a meter stick to estimate height of plants within quadrat

        x.  Pick a medium height plant? Or multiple canopy levels?

    h.  Record number of observable pollinators

    i.  Record percentage of leaf area with disease symptoms

        xi. Use phone app to take pictures of a few leaves with
            white/blue paper underneath

4.  Supplies (5 each)

    j.  Quadrats

    k.  Data sheets

    l.  Pencils

    m.  Clipboards

    n.  Blue or white blank pieces of paper

    o.  Phone apps (tell them to download ahead of time)

    p.  Meter sticks
