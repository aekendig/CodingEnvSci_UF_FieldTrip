**Study Purpose**

The high demand for employees with computer science skills in the U.S.
tech industry has spurred many programs aimed to teach K-12 students how
to code (NSF, 2013). Students are increasingly gaining opportunities to
learn how to code in their classrooms and through school-associated
clubs (Google Inc. & Gallup Inc., 2016b). In addition to preparing
students for future jobs, coding increases broadly applicable skills,
such as critical thinking (Lye & Koh, 2014) and confidence through
failure (Saujani, 2016), which can be particularly important for gender
and ethnic minority students to learn. However, minority student groups
report a lack of interest in learning computer science and a lack of
relatable role models (Google Inc. & Gallup Inc., 2016a), which are
driven by widely disseminated non-inclusive stereotypes (Cheryan,
Master, & Meltzoff, 2015). Breaking down this stereotype of who computer
programmers are and what their jobs entail is an important step towards
increasing interest in computer science careers and skill development
among gender and ethnic minorities in the U.S.

One method for increasing the interests of women and other gender
minorities in careers that use coding is to introduce them to people and
environments that do not fit the masculine, tech-focused stereotypes
depicted in media and other settings (Cheryan et al., 2015). While
female undergraduate enrollment in mathematics and computer science
programs is approximately 27%, females comprise 60% of undergraduate
agricultural and biological science majors (Shaw & Stanton, 2012).
Therefore, harnessing female students' preexisting interest in
biological sciences may be an effective strategy for increasing interest
in coding. In addition, non-traditional educational activities increase
student interest in science and engineering fields (Dabney et al.,
2012). Consequently, we expect that an educational event that teaches
women and gender minority students about how coding in used in
environmental science research (specifically, ecology) will increase
their interest in pursuing computer science education and careers that
utilize these skills and their confidence in achieving these goals.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a single
day educational event in achieving learning gains and attitude changes
among participants. The learning gains include: (1) increased
understanding of ecological concepts (invasive species, plant disease,
and biodiversity), (2) ability to articulate the broader relevance of
ecological concepts, and (3) familiarity with how to code in the program
R. The attitude changes include: (1) confidence in ability to code, (2)
confidence in ability to pursue a career that involves coding, if
desired, and (3) increased interest in coding and its potential
application to multiple careers. The curriculum will be delivered in an
educational setting (i.e. a university greenhouse, field lab, and
classroom) using established instructional techniques (i.e. lectures and
active learning).
